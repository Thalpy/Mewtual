# CatComs — Handover

Authoritative current-state document. Read this first, then
[`INTERFACES.md`](INTERFACES.md) (the API/seam schema) and
[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) (decisions + the adversarial-review fixes).

## Status (as of 2026-06-22)

- **Phases 0 → 7 COMPLETE; Phase 8 (product model + Tauri desktop UI) in progress.**
  6e-3d and Phase 7 (every networking + NAT-traversal path proven end-to-end over real
  TCP — direct/discovered/relayed/DCUtR — plus the consolidated security suite) are
  done. Phase 8 so far: the UI-facing **`catcoms-app`** product model + an async
  **event-stream actor** (8a/8b-1, fully test-gated), and a first **Tauri 2 + Svelte
  desktop app** (`apps/desktop`, 8b-2 … 8d) wired to the stack — found a server, mint a
  single-use invite, a second instance joins via paste, **multiple name-addressed
  channels**, live chat. **194 tests passing** (the GUI WebView is the one
  manually-verified surface; both halves compile). **The desktop app is currently
  loopback-only** — it works between windows on one machine; connecting peers across a
  network needs the discovery/relay-in-the-UI slice (not yet built). See Known
  limitations.
- Both CRITICALs the 6e-3d design pass found are **closed and adversarially reviewed**:
  **A1** (the pre-existing bug where the gossip topics hashed the plaintext-invite
  `group_id`, so any invite-holder could read all topics) and **Sybil-C1** (the
  catch-up source-trust hole). See [`design-6e-rendezvous.md`](design-6e-rendezvous.md).
- The four security-critical closing slices (6–9) each passed an **adversarial-review
  workflow before commit**; one **blocking** finding was fixed in each of 3d-7 (a
  member-on-member PEX CPU-DoS — receive-side bundle uncapped) and 3d-8 (a variable-time
  cache integrity-tag compare — timing oracle); 3d-6 and 3d-9 were SOUND with cheap
  hardening folded in. The whole block ends with a **memory end-to-end test**: a joiner
  discovers the inviter at a zero-knowledge rendezvous and joins with **no hard-coded
  server address**.
- Toolchain pinned **Rust 1.89.0** (`rust-toolchain.toml`; automerge 0.10 needs it).
- 9 library crates + 1 binary. The protocol layers are tested deterministically with
  N in-process nodes over an in-memory transport; the mesh is *additionally* tested
  over **real libp2p** — the memory transport (real swarms/Noise/req-resp), TCP
  loopback (real sockets, multi-process `serve`/`join`), a circuit relay, a DCUtR
  hole-punch upgrade, and a rendezvous register→discover.
- Local-only repo (`git init`'d, no remote). Commits are linear on `main`,
  one per phase/block.

## What CatComs is

A peer-to-peer, serverless, end-to-end-encrypted, invite-only group comms system —
"Signal + federation". Each "server/connection" is its own MLS (RFC 9420) group;
per-device identity; encrypted CRDT documents (channels/wiki/status/calendar)
replicated over a libp2p mesh with zero-knowledge relays. Targets Linux, Windows,
Android via a Rust core + (eventually) Tauri 2.

The four locked decisions and the pre-implementation adversarial-review fixes are
in [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) §1–§2 — **read them; they constrain everything.**

## Crate map

| Crate | Responsibility |
|-------|----------------|
| `catcoms-wire` | Canonical, injective, length-prefixed codec; domain-separated key-derivation contexts (`DocType`, `exporter_context`). |
| `catcoms-rt` | The **seams**: `Clock`, RNG (`OsCryptoRng`/`CryptoRngCore`), and `MeshTransport` (pub/sub + request/response) with an in-memory `MemNetwork`/`Hub` for tests. |
| `catcoms-crypto` | Content-addressed `DeviceId`/`UserId`; Ed25519 device/account keys; device-cert chains + `Roster`; the unified key hierarchy (`Dek`→HKDF subkeys), XChaCha20 `seal`/`unseal`, tiered `SecureKeyStore`. |
| `catcoms-mls` | MLS group core (openmls 0.8): `MlsDevice`, `ServerGroup` (create/add/remove/process/epoch/`channel_secret`), single-use device-bound `InviteToken` (now `INVITE_DOMAIN` **v2**, carrying a signature-bound `rendezvous: Vec<String>`; `mint_invite_with_rendezvous`) + `InviteLedger`, `AddOutcome`, `designated_committer`. |
| `catcoms-replication` | Encrypted CRDT docs (automerge 0.10): inner-signed `SignedOp`, `SealedOp` (per-epoch channel-key sealing), `EncryptedDoc` (edit/ingest/catch-up). |
| `catcoms-storage` | Content-addressed `Cid` blob stores (mem + fs); per-file encryption (`FileRef`, per-file wrap nonce); `RetentionIndex` (3-scope expiry, GC with decorrelated eviction + `HolderOracle` probe). |
| `catcoms-net` | libp2p `MeshService` realizing `MeshTransport` (gossipsub + request/response over Noise+yamux). NAT traversal: relay-client + **circuit-relay-v2** + **DCUtR** hole-punch (`next_direct_upgrade()`). Standalone zero-knowledge infra: `build_relay_swarm`/`run_relay` and `build_rendezvous_swarm`/`run_rendezvous` (`RelayBehaviour`/`RendezvousBehaviour`). **Rendezvous client** in `MeshBehaviour`: `rendezvous_register`/`rendezvous_discover`; discovered records surface via `next_discovered()` (per-response capped) and are **never auto-dialed**. `add_external_address()` (register without a relay), `validate_rendezvous_addrs()` (reject circuit / require one `/p2p/` / distinct PeerIds). `connection_limits` on every swarm. Tracing-instrumented. |
| `catcoms-discovery` | **Pure** eclipse-resistance layer (no I/O, no ambient time/RNG). `DiscoveryPolicy` ranks discovered candidates into a bounded, Clock-paced/RNG-jittered **dial plan** (the only thing that decides what to dial): member-tag-verified → multi-rendezvous-corroborated → cache → junk-last, ≤1 root/rendezvous, roster-clamped, seq-freshness. Advisory `EclipseDetector` (D/R/S + hysteresis; never gates). Cross-session `AddressCache` (proven members, RNG-jittered eviction, BLAKE3 keyed integrity tag → tamper-detected on load; SQLCipher backing deferred). |
| `catcoms-sync` | `ChannelSync`: replication + membership over the transport. Blinded **member-only gossip topics keyed under `ns_secret_L`** that rotate on member removal (routing label `L`), grandfathered re-subscription window. The **join handshake** transfers the **routing state** (sealed, signature-bound). Membership **commit propagation**; **missed-commit recovery** with **signed catch-up responses** (nonce+epoch anti-replay) + a **two-pool peer model**; bounded zeroized **past-epoch key window**. Discovery surface: `rendezvous_namespaces()`, the pre-dial **member tag** (`membership_tag`/`verify_membership_tag`), **member PEX** (`PeerDescriptor`, `request_pex`/`publish_self_record`/`ingest_peer_record`/`known_peer_records`), the pre-join **`join_namespace()`**, and `transport()` (so the discovery/dial layer above can drive register/discover/dial). `SyncStats`. |
| `catcoms-app` | **Product model** — the UI-facing facade over the stack (so a GUI never touches MLS/automerge). `Server<T,R>` (found/join/open_channel/send_message/messages/members/invite), the canonical chat-message schema (`append_message`/`read_messages`), and the async **event-stream actor** (`spawn` → `ServerActor` commands + `AppEvent` stream: `ChannelUpdated`/`MembersChanged`/`Closed`). |
| `catcoms-log` | `tracing` subscriber init; `init_debug(debug, dir)` writes `debug_log_<ts>.txt`. |
| `apps/desktop` | **Tauri 2 + Svelte 5 desktop app** (its own cargo workspace, excluded from the root). A thin `#[tauri::command]` bridge (`src-tauri`) over the `catcoms-app` actor + a Svelte frontend. Found a server, #general, send/read. The WebView is the one manually-verified surface; `npm install && npm run tauri dev`. |
| `bins/catcomsctl` | Dev CLI. `demo` runs the whole stack end-to-end (in-process); `serve`/`join` run it across **real OS processes over TCP** (optionally `serve --relay`); `relay` and `rendezvous` run the zero-knowledge infra nodes; `recover` drives the 6d-1b miss-and-heal path; `--debug`/`--stats`. |

## Build / verify ritual (run before every commit)

```sh
cargo build --all
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings   # must be clean
cargo fmt --all -- --check                                  # must be clean
cargo test --all                                            # all green
bash scripts/check-no-ambient.sh                            # ambient-dependency gate
```

PowerShell helper to sum test results (Windows dev box):
```pwsh
$out = cargo test --all 2>&1 | Out-String
([regex]::Matches($out,"(\d+) passed")|%{[int]$_.Groups[1].Value}|measure -sum).Sum
```
(`-match "FAILED"` is a false positive — it case-insensitively matches "0 failed".)

## Dev loop

```sh
cargo run -p catcomsctl -- demo                 # in-process: found -> invite -> join -> E2E chat -> converge
cargo run -p catcomsctl -- recover --stats      # 6d-1b: a member misses a commit and self-heals
cargo run -p catcomsctl -- --stats demo         # print per-node SyncStats counters
RUST_LOG=catcoms_sync=trace cargo run -p catcomsctl -- demo
# Real multi-process over libp2p (terminals 1+2; add --host <ip> to cross machines):
cargo run -p catcomsctl -- serve --port 9000 --invite-file invite.txt
cargo run -p catcomsctl -- join  --invite-file invite.txt
# NAT traversal + discovery infra (each runs until Ctrl-C):
cargo run -p catcomsctl -- relay --port 4000        # zero-knowledge circuit relay
cargo run -p catcomsctl -- rendezvous --port 5000   # zero-knowledge rendezvous
# Discovery: the server registers at a rendezvous under the invite's join_ns; the
# joiner discovers it there and joins with NO hard-coded server address:
cargo run -p catcomsctl -- serve --port 9000 --rendezvous /ip4/<rz-ip>/tcp/5000/p2p/<rz-id>
cargo run -p catcomsctl -- join                     # discover -> dial (via DiscoveryPolicy) -> join
```
`demo` runs both members in one process over the in-memory transport; `serve`/`join`
run the *same* join + catch-up path across **separate OS processes over real libp2p
TCP** (verified, incl. through a relay).

## Working conventions (important — keep doing these)

- **Block by block, test-gated.** Build a coherent block, make all tests pass + the
  full ritual clean, commit, then continue. Efficacy over speed.
- **No ambient time/RNG.** All time flows through `Clock`, all randomness through an
  injected `CryptoRngCore`. The only sanctioned OS sources are
  `catcoms-rt/src/{clock,rng}.rs`; `scripts/check-no-ambient.sh` enforces it (extend
  its allowlist deliberately).
- **Adversarial-review workflows for security-critical protocol code.** This caught
  a genuine **HIGH** in the network join (group-substitution) and corrected the
  membership-linearization design against the openmls source. Pattern: design/build,
  then run a `Workflow` of hostile reviewers (crypto / DoS / guarantee-preservation /
  distributed-systems), fold findings in, then commit. Don't skip it for membership /
  admission / key-handling changes.
- **Commit messages** end with the `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 (1M context)`
  line. Use `git commit -F <file>` for messages containing `==`/quotes (PowerShell
  here-strings mangle them).
- **Memory**: `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/` holds durable facts; this repo's
  `docs/` holds the detailed handover. Keep both current.

### Earlier blocks (history)
6d-1b (missed-commit recovery + past-epoch key window) and 6d-2 (fork resolution +
the convergence-safe single-serializer membership model) are complete; their details
live in the commit messages and [`design-6d2.md`](design-6d2.md). The default config
stays **single designated committer** — the concurrent-committer / fork path is OFF
by default (`max_committer_rank=0`) pending **I1** (a wall-clock contest window can
converge honest nodes differently under async timing); re-read `design-6d2.md` before
touching it.

## 6e-3d — COMPLETE (rendezvous discovery + eclipse-resistance)

**Read [`design-6e-rendezvous.md`](design-6e-rendezvous.md)** — the 9-slice contract
from a 7-agent design+review workflow, plus the per-slice adversarial-review outcomes
(2b, 3d-5, and 3d-6…9 are all recorded there). All 9 slices are done.

**Phase 7** (end-to-end local integration over real sockets + consolidated security
suite) is **COMPLETE**. Every networking + NAT-traversal path is proven end-to-end over
**real TCP loopback sockets** (not just the libp2p memory transport): **direct**
(`tcp_e2e.rs`, 7a), **rendezvous-discovered** with no hard-coded address
(`tcp_rendezvous_e2e.rs`, 7c), **relayed** NAT-traversal (`tcp_relay_e2e.rs`, 7d), and a
**relayed→direct DCUtR upgrade** driven through a full join (`tcp_dcutr_e2e.rs`, 7e).
The consolidated security suite (`security.rs`, 7b) maps the threat model to where each
property is proven and adds the cross-layer scenarios (eclipse-never-gates-a-removal;
removed-member-excluded-from-the-rotated-namespace). Deeper adversarial scenarios are
deferred to **Phase 10** (the dedicated hardening + security-review phase). The next
focus is **Phase 8** — the product model + Tauri desktop UI.

**Goal:** members find each other with no hard-coded bootstrap addresses, and an
attacker cannot isolate (eclipse) a member. Everything is built on a per-removal
routing secret `ns_secret_L`:

- **Foundation (3d-1/2a/2b, done).** `ns_secret_L` is snapshotted at each member
  **removal** (counter `L`), retained `{L-2,L-1,L}` in `ChannelSync`. The blinded
  gossip topics **and** rendezvous namespaces both derive from it (keyed BLAKE3), so a
  non-member can't compute them and they **rotate on removal** (forward secrecy for
  routing metadata). Because the secret is epoch-specific, the **join handshake
  transfers it** (sealed, bound into the inviter signature) so every member — founder,
  joiner, *post-removal* joiner — derives identical topics. Re-keying the topics
  **closed the pre-existing A1 CRITICAL**.
- **Discovery (3d-3/4, done).** A zero-knowledge rendezvous **server** (`catcomsctl
  rendezvous`) and a **client** in `MeshBehaviour`: register a signed peer record under
  a blinded namespace, discover others. Discovered records are **surfaced, never
  auto-dialed** — the dial decision (and eclipse-resistance) lives a layer up.
- **Source trust (3d-5, done).** Commit catch-up responses are now **signed** by the
  responder's MLS leaf key, bound to the request; a **two-pool** model separates
  untrusted candidates from verified `member_peers`. **Closed Sybil-C1.**

**Eclipse-resistance (3d-6…9, done, each adversarially reviewed):**
- **3d-6** — pure `catcoms-discovery` `DiscoveryPolicy` (rank candidates → bounded,
  Clock-paced/RNG-jittered dial plan; ≤1 root/rendezvous; roster clamp; seq-freshness;
  the only thing that decides what to dial). Plus the pre-dial **membership tag** and
  the catch-up **nonce/epoch anti-replay** (closing the 3d-5 deferred items).
- **3d-7** — **member PEX** (`KIND_PEX`): members supply each other dialable
  `PeerDescriptor`s without a rendezvous; responder-signed, members-only, capped +
  rate-limited; entries are discovery candidates (never auto-promoted to the trusted
  catch-up pool).
- **3d-8** — advisory **`EclipseDetector`** (D/R/S + hysteresis; never gates) +
  cross-session **`AddressCache`** (proven members, tamper-detected load).
- **3d-9** — invite rewiring (signature-bound `rendezvous` vector, `INVITE_DOMAIN`
  v2), pre-join **`join_namespace`**, and `serve --rendezvous`/`join`
  **discover→dial→join** (DiscoveryPolicy-mediated) — verified by a memory end-to-end
  test (no hard-coded server address).

## Known limitations / deferred (the security-relevant ones)

- **Desktop app is loopback-only + dev/release build distinction (Phase 8).** The
  `apps/desktop` bridge founds servers on `127.0.0.1` and mints invites carrying a
  loopback bootstrap address, so two instances only connect on the **same machine**.
  Connecting peers across a network is the deferred **discovery/relay-in-the-UI** slice
  (the protocol already supports it — Phase 7 proves direct/relayed/rendezvous over real
  TCP; it is just not wired into `found`/`join` yet). Two routes when built: a
  port-forwarded public IP, or a public relay (the proper NAT-traversal path). Also: a
  **`cargo build` (debug) exe is a dev build** that loads the UI from the Vite dev server
  (`localhost:1420`) and shows "can't reach the page" on any machine without it — to
  distribute, build a release exe with the frontend embedded
  (`npm run build && npm run tauri build -- --no-bundle`; needs WebView2 on the target).
- **Network admission is single-committer-only** (only the lowest-leaf-index member
  admits). Concurrent admits / fork resolution + cross-member single-use = 6d-2.
- **Commit catch-up needs a peer that still holds the commit.** A member behind by
  more than a serving peer's `max_commit_log` window can't recover via commit
  catch-up — a full snapshot rejoin (deferred) is required; the gap is logged and a
  bad source is excluded, but exhausting all sources surfaces only a warning (a
  recovery *event* to the app is a follow-up).
- **Catch-up auth is now nonce-bound (6e-3d-6).** Catch-up *responses* are signed by a
  current member and bound to `(group_id, requester pubkey, req_ts, **nonce**, **epoch**,
  bundle)`, and requests carry a fresh signed timestamp + per-request RNG nonce — so a
  captured response cannot be replayed against a different request and the same-ms `ts`
  collision window is closed. Residual: there is still no *server-side* seen-nonce log,
  so a captured *request* can be re-sent within `MAX_REQUEST_AGE_MS` (60s) — harmless
  (the member just re-serves a freshly-signed bundle; the Noise transport confines it to
  the peer's own session). A full snapshot rejoin for a too-far-behind member is the
  remaining recovery gap.
- **6e-3d discovery is built (eclipse-resistance complete).** `DiscoveryPolicy`
  (ranked, budgeted dial plan), the pre-dial membership tag, member PEX, the advisory
  eclipse detector, and the cross-session cache are all in (6e-3d-6…9), and a joiner can
  bootstrap via `join_ns` with no hard-coded address. Residual / deferred (all
  availability-only, review-confirmed): the **cross-session cache is in-memory** (its
  SQLCipher persistence is storage-phase work); `catcomsctl serve --rendezvous`
  **registers once** and does not yet re-register before the rendezvous TTL lapses; the
  `join` path uses the **first** rendezvous only (no multi-rendezvous fall-through yet);
  and `--host` must be a raw IP. The net Actor never auto-dials; the dial decision and
  all bounds live in `catcoms-discovery`.
- **A forged future `CommitRecord`** on the control topic is bounded (gap +
  buffer caps, deduped catch-up) and fails MLS verification at apply time. Per-peer
  rate limiting + exponential catch-up backoff are a hardening follow-up.
- **Persistent sealed MLS storage** is deferred: each device uses openmls's
  in-memory provider; tying group state to the Phase-1 `mls_seal_key` + SQLCipher
  (and the local metadata index) is platform/storage-phase work.
- **Metadata** is the dominant residual: who-talks-to-whom, timing, group sizes, the
  member IPs a DCUtR upgrade reveals to the peer, and — now — a **rendezvous** node
  learning `namespace ↔ IP ↔ timing` for the registration TTL (a higher-value target
  than a relay; querying ≥2 rendezvous doubles the operators who see it). Per-rendezvous
  namespace diversification removes the cross-operator join key; rotation-on-removal
  limits long-term linkage but leaks a removal-cadence signal. Mitigated, not eliminated
  (≥2 relays/rendezvous, cover traffic, staying relayed). Relays/rendezvous only ever
  see Noise+MLS ciphertext / opaque namespaces. See ARCHITECTURE §3.
- **Per-peer rate limiting / off-actor offload** of join work: a hardening follow-up.
- **`tracing` retrofit** for the earlier crypto/storage crates: deferred (user OK'd).

## Where the design/review outputs live

Design passes and adversarial reviews run as background `Workflow`s; their structured
output is under the session's `tasks/<id>.output`. The load-bearing conclusions are
distilled into the design docs and the memory files — **read the design doc for the
block you're touching**:
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` §1–§2 — the four locked decisions + the initial corrections;
  §4a/§4b — join + commit propagation; §3 — honest residual risks.
- [`design-6d2.md`](design-6d2.md) — fork resolution / single-serializer membership
  (committer = lowest **leaf index**; the **I1** gate keeping concurrent committers off).
- [`design-6e-relay.md`](design-6e-relay.md) — relay-v2 + DCUtR.
- [`design-6e-rendezvous.md`](design-6e-rendezvous.md) — **the active block**:
  rendezvous discovery + eclipse-resistance, the 9-slice contract, and the recorded
  per-slice adversarial-review outcomes (A1/2b and Sybil-C1/3d-5) with their deferred
  follow-ups.
